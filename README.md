Description: The National Survey of College Graduates, conducted by the 
National Science Foundation, provides valuable data on the characteristics 
of individuals with a bachelor's or higher degree, particularly those with 
education and employment in science or engineering. The objective of this 
study is to investigate the impact of community college on individuals 
who eventually graduate and their job satisfaction after graduation. To 
achieve this objective, we will employ machine learning algo rithms such 
as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to develop predictive models.
We have used the data from National Survey of College Graduates and the 
Survey of Doctorate Recipients to identify patterns and relationships 
among various factors such as demographics, educational background,
and employment status that may influence job satisfaction.
